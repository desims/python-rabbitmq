# High-Traffic Chatbot Microservice ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the High-Traffic Chatbot Microservice project! This repository contains the implementation of a robust backend service designed to handle massive message flows in a simulated high-traffic environment. The system leverages Python and RabbitMQ to ensure reliability, scalability, and performance.

## Introduction
This project simulates a high-traffic chatbot environment where users send queries to a backend system, and the system processes and responds to each message efficiently.

Key objectives:

- Handle high message volumes.
- Ensure reliable processing with RabbitMQ.
- Provide scalable solutions for real-world use cases.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- RabbitMQ installed and running locally
## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/desims/python-rabbitmq.git```
```cd your-repo-name```
3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Start RabbitMQ on your local machine.
   
## Run the Producer
```python send.py```

## Run the Consumer
```python receive.py```

# Implementation
## Message Producer
- Publishes messages to a fanout exchange in RabbitMQ.
- Simulates high-traffic with randomized and sequential messages.

```python
def main():
    # Connect to RabbitMQ
    connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host=RABBITMQ_HOST))
    channel = connection.channel()

    # Declare a fanout exchange
    channel.exchange_declare(exchange=EXCHANGE_NAME, exchange_type="fanout")

    print("Starting to send messages...")
    while True:
        # Create a simple random message
        message = {
            "from":"user",
            "message": choice(MESSAGES), 
            "date":datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
        }
        message_body = json.dumps(message)

        # Publish to the fanout exchange
        channel.basic_publish(exchange=EXCHANGE_NAME, routing_key="", body=message_body)
        print(f"Sent: {message}")

        # Simulate high traffic
        time.sleep(0.5)
```
## Message Consumer
- Listens to the queue and processes incoming messages.
- Provides chatbot-like responses based on messages map:
   "Hello" â†’ "Hi there! ðŸ˜Š"
   "Tell me a joke" â†’ "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side! ðŸ˜‚"
```python
def main():
    # Connect to RabbitMQ
    connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host=RABBITMQ_HOST))
    channel = connection.channel()

    # Declare a temporary queue to bind to the exchange
    result = channel.queue_declare(queue="", exclusive=True)
    queue_name = result.method.queue

    # Bind the queue to the exchange
    channel.queue_bind(exchange=EXCHANGE_NAME, queue=queue_name)

    print("Chatbot is ready and listening for messages...")
    channel.basic_consume(queue=queue_name, on_message_callback=callback)

    try:
        channel.start_consuming()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Stopping the chatbot...")
        connection.close()
```

## Error Handling & Logging
The service uses robust logging to track its operations and errors. Logs are formatted with timestamps for easy debugging and are written to both a file (`consumer.log`) and the console.
```3_receive_log.py```
```python
# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s]: %(message)s",
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler("consumer.log"),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
```
Sample logging and logging output
```python
        logging.info("Message saved to MongoDB.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to save message to MongoDB: {e}")
```

## Health Checks
This project implements a **health check endpoint** for monitoring a RabbitMQ consumer service and its connected components (e.g., MongoDB). It ensures real-time visibility into service health.
Feature :
- **Health Check Endpoint**: Monitors RabbitMQ, MongoDB, and processing status.
- **Multithreading**: Runs Flask health checks alongside the RabbitMQ consumer.
- **Detailed Status**: Returns `"ok"` or `"degraded"` with component details.
```4_receive_health.py```
```python
# Health Check Endpoint
@app.route('/health', methods=['GET'])
def health_check():
    """Health check endpoint."""
    with service_health_lock:
        return jsonify({
            "status": "ok" if service_health["rabbitmq_connected"] and service_health["processing"] and service_health["mongodb_connected"] else "degraded",
            "details": service_health
        })

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run Flask app for health checks in a separate thread
    flask_thread = threading.Thread(target=app.run, kwargs={"port": 8080, "use_reloader": False})
    flask_thread.daemon = True
    flask_thread.start()
```
## Scalability Enhancements
- Database Integration: Store processed messages for future analytics using MongoDB
```python
# MongoDB configuration
MONGO_URI = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
DB_NAME = "chat_service"
COLLECTION_NAME = "message_history"

def save_message_to_db(user_message, bot_response):
    """
    Save the processed message to MongoDB.
    """
    if not service_health["mongodb_connected"]:
        logging.error("Cannot save message: MongoDB is not connected.")
        return

    try:
        message = {
            "user_message": user_message,
            "bot_response": bot_response,
            "timestamp": datetime.now()
        }
        message_collection.insert_one(message)
        logging.info("Message saved to MongoDB.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to save message to MongoDB: {e}")
```
